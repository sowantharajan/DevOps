Feature branch workflow steps:

1. Clone project:
git clone git@example.com:project-name.git

2. Create branch with your feature:
git checkout -b $feature_name

3. Write code. Commit changes:
git add filenames
git commit -am "My feature is ready"

4. Push your branch to GitLab (Remote):
git push origin $feature_name

5. Review your code on commits page.
6. Create a merge request.
7. Your team lead will review the code & merge it to the main branch
